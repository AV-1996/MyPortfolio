Frontline was one of the first products to be introduced to the market and fleas have been exposed to it more than most other products, meaning they have built up a tolerance.  Flea meds effectiveness varies depending on the area you live. This product is basically a generic of Frontline (same active ingredient).  If Frontline doesn't work for you, this product won't either.\n\nI've been using this on my indoor only cats as a preventative and so far it works great!  I have two indoor cats and two indoor/outdoor dogs.  One of my cats has a really severe flea allergy that will land her at the vet if she gets bit by even one flea.  Using prescription meds on my dogs and over the counter stuff on my cats (who are less likely to encounter fleas) seems to be the trick.  This is priced MUCH lower than Frontline (which runs about 4X as much as the Sentry brand generic), which is awesome.  It's also packaged nicely and seems to be more concentrated than Frontline so I don't' end up dumping a bunch of liquid on my cats, who aren't excited about flea med time anyway.", "summary": "Great for my indoor cats!", "unixReviewTime": 1520294400}

If you have a pooch who wolfs their food down, they may be susceptible to bloat. I lost a dog to that condition--he died overnight with very little warning. Our vet said that he has seen bloat kill a dog in half an hour.\n\nWe currently have 2 German Shorthairs [who could care less about meals] and a Plott Hound. The Plott is super food oriented, as is typical of the breed. Think of Labrador on meth! Before using this bowl, he would consume all of his food quickly and then bully the other two dogs away from their bowls. Sometimes I would feed him outside, but I have better things to do than babysit dogs at mealtime.\n\nAfter the second time of losing his dinner on the living room carpet I decided to get the large Teal bowl. This has been the BEST purchase! Now \"Ollie\" is the last to finish his food--by a long shot. Being a hound, I think that he actually enjoys the \"chase\" of getting his food from this feeder. Although an intelligent breed, he has yet to figure out that he could still go bully the other dogs for their food. Again, I believe that the challenge of getting the food from the nooks and crannies of the Slow Feeder is engaging for him. He has slimmed down a few pound too--because he is consuming less.\n\nThe feeder is pretty easy to clean. I use a bottle brush and a little dish soap. The description says that you can wash it in the dishwasher, but I only do a load every 2 or 3 days, and I feed the dogs 2X per day.\n\nMost importantly, feeding the Plott this way substantially reduces his possibility of experiencing bloat. It could well extend his life. If you have a dog who eats quickly, this bowl is insurance!\n\nPS--although I prefer stainless steel--and there are some slow feeders available in SS, I wanted the tighter pattern of this bowl.

The malinois is ball crazy and a heavy chewer, the Dutch mix has average interest in toys and not a heavy chewer. Both love these jumbler balls.\nWhen I got my mal he was 11 months old and his previous owner gave me a bunch of toys that she had already purchased for him, one of which was the Jumbler x large.  The previous owner told me that the mal had removed the squeaker from the Jumbler when he was younger and ended up at the vet (though I don't think he was actually sick, she just got worried).  Aside from that, this toy was one of his favorites and lasted another year of use with both my dogs playing with it.\nI recently purchased two more, and noticed that they were not the same as each other. They were same color, but when I went to remove the squeakers (to avoid any problems), I found that though they looked the same as each other, they had different types of squeakers -one was much easier to remove. Since removing the squeakers, the seams on one of the balls has split. The other one is still in pretty good shape.\nBased on the different structures, I am guessing that the 2 new jumblers were not from the same batch. Not sure if Kong changed the design and we got an old and a new one, or if they were from different factories, but I would have to say it's a crapshoot as to whether you'll get one that holds up or not. My dogs love these too much for me to toss, but I don't leave them home alone with these balls- generally they only get them while outside, and when I'm checking on them.", "summary": "QUALITY VARIES!

The pump is still going strong! It fits nicely on the counter where I feed the cats (my blind chow chow likes cat food). It is a bit loud for a quiet room, but I've gotten used to it; I think the fish tank pumps in the adjacent dining room are much louder.\n\nAll three of my cats LOVE it. My skittish girl Ellie really likes to play in it, and Alex (the flippant boy) loves it to pieces. Sparta has been drinking significantly more, which is the reason I bought it; he gets UTIs and I thought this might encourage him to drink more since it's like a tap he can use all the time! He really seems to like it. It's definitely helped us cut back on vet bills... though I still take him often, he's been hospitalized once for UTI-related issues since I got this fifteen months ago, compared to three times in the six months before I got it.\n\nPros:\n-Good for 1-3 cats (would not recommend for 4+)\n-Cats seem to like it\n-Has adjustable rates of flow\n-Filters aren't INSANELY expensive...\n-Disassembles easily for cleaning (pump moderately difficult to get apart)\n-Cats CANNOT knock it over. Ellie has tried. Ellie can knock over anything. Ellie has failed for the last fifteen months. 5 stars for that alone.\n-The cord is really long; It's 4-6 feet which is great.\n\nCons:\n-Pump tends to gunk up with cat hair. I clean it every two weeks, but honestly would recommend every week for fluffy cats.\n-Pump tube to get the water to the top is really hard to clean! I've been using a baby bottle brush kit, which works decently.\n-Box at the wall plug gets super hot. Would not put near melty or flamable items.... this has not been an issue but you know if you bump it. NEEDS AIR FLOW.\n\nThough I do need to refill it daily (1-2 small dixie cups, is all), it's great when I'm home! When I'm gone for a few days I unplug it and use a large bowl instead, since I don't want it to get too low and burn out the pump. They still drink from this one if it's still, and I've come back to this one low and the other untouched entirely.\n\nIf I bought again, I'd get the one with the back tank.

Also, these are so long that we couldn't use them on the Pit because the only one that fit her muzzle was size 4 (going from smallest to largest) and it covered her eyes.  Second, my dogs figured out how to take them off in about 20 seconds.....and proceeded to shred them in about 5 seconds.  There is absolutely no way these would stop a dog from biting, either, unless you use a smaller size than the dog needs (which would be cruel). They only came with 3 clips so be warned.

That being said I was hesitant to buy this for my dog and cats (obviously bought the dog the one intended for dogs).  I was worried about the collar causing irritations and I've never known a flea collar that actually worked.  Plus my cats have never worn collars, so I wasn't sure how they would respond.  I live in southwest Florida, we have fleas year round because of the tropical weather and most fleas are resistant to the flea medications on the market.  My cats are indoor cats (two) and my dog does not spend a lot of time outside, just out for walks.  So for the past three years I have only treated the dog for fleas and all was fine, until last month when I found all three animals being bitten by fleas.  I've had the dog on program, obviously this is no longer working.  So I decided to try this collar for all of them.  I was very surprised that within about 4 hours the itching was noticeably less.  Two days later and I can say the animals seem to be flea free for the most part.  Now I'm sure it will take a full cycle or two for all the fleas in the house to die off, but I am VERY happy with the results.  I was nervous enough that the first day I put the collars on them I stayed home to watch for any bad reactions, and I check their necks daily to make sure they are ok, so far so good!", "summary": "Works great even in Florida", "unixReviewTime": 1525824000}

This plant is so pretty and such a visual statement piece in the aquarium that  I wish I had more tanks for it!\n\nEach pot contained three plants.  I divided them into two aquariums where they have been planted for a week now. There is some melt and the loss of a leaf or two in the 40g, which is to be expected as they adjust to each aquarium's unique ecology, different to the grower's set up they had known. I have some regular val in the same tank and it melted away almost completely when first introduced, then grew back vigorously, so I expect similar for the new arrivals, especially as the newly shipped roots are so short.\n\nTwo of them had really short roots, about 1/4 inch, so they kept popping up. I had to resort to a tiny dab of Superglue to attach the escapees to an obliging small rock so the roots could nestle down into the substrate. The others had roots of about 3/8 to 1/2 inch so they did stay down, barely.  I need to be careful not to jostle them or make too much current nearby when doing maintenance as the leaves are extra fragile while they semi soften due to change in water parameters and until they establish a deeper root system.\nNote:  Greenpro advised planting into substrate as soon as possible and not to just put it into the tank still in the pot. Apparently leaving the roots in rock wool puts them at risk of rot?\n\nThe first one I ordered arrived damaged as the rock wool root ball had popped loose from the plastic pot in transit and slammed around in the package, bruising and cracking the leaves beyond hope. I sent pics and Greenpro customer service was top notch, sending a replacement which I was able to piggy-back onto a second order. Successful shipping the second time around, all the way from CA to the east coast in May with temps in the high 70's, very low 80's F.\n\nTwo of them are planted in a 40g breeder tank which is 2/3 Walstad style and one third beach. The v. spiralis are in the beach area which has a one inch substrate of pool sand, sieved through a fine mesh sieve so that only the larger grains were retained and used (to increase beach aeration). Beneath the sand where the vals go there is some added Eco Complete substrate, a teaspoon of ground baked eggshells to add minerals, and a small blob of low fire red terra cotta clay to add iron.\nThe others are individually replanted, dirted Walstad style, in glass pots and are in a 29 gallon cycled holding tank.\n\nLove them.", "summary": "Gorgeous plant, great customer service from Greenpro", "unixReviewTime": 1527206400}

He was a bit reluctant when putting the collar over his head but he dealt with it because he knew he would get to go on the walk. The harness fits him perfectly, he is 15lbs and I bought a medium.

We have 2 brothers about a year old and FULL OF ENERGY. They are climbers, the higher the better. I purchased the small based off previous reviews and photos from other customers. It looked like it would be large enough for my boys. While the outside holes are big enough, the inside holes for them to get between the levels are a little snug for the bigger of our two boys. He squeezes through with a little effort, but it doesn't stop him at all. I wonder if the holes would be bigger on the larger version, if anyone knows, please let me know! Overall great purchase, they've been in and out of it non stop for the last 24 hours we've had it up. We have it hanging on a hall closet door and didn't need the provided bumpers. I attached a few pics of our boys, Sammy and Dean.", "summary": "Great for larger cats, inside holes a wee bit snug though....", "unixReviewTime": 1516579200}
