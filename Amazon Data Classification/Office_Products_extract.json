When reviewing paper, like when reviewing a book, most folk don't use an objective standard.  I tend to put paper into two categories, coated and uncoated (e.g., smooth and toothy).  Then, I go from there.\n\nThis paper is smooth and has very little bleed through.  I usually use no more than a medium nib when I write.  My preference is Clairefontaine 90g paper over Rodia.  I had a bit better flow and a bit less bleed through.  Ive also used Mnemosyne paper as well in this category of silky smooth paper.\n\nNow, my personal preference.  If I had to rate this against what I enjoy writing on, I would give it 3 stars.  I have found that I like a little more toothe when I write.  In return for this choice, I give up som of the bleed through and feathering I get in return.  But when choosing which pain do I want, Ill take a little more bleed and a little more feathering.

The fit and finish of the brass barrel is very good, and it comes in a metal box like the Kaweco pen.  It takes a regular refillable ink converter, included, unlike the mini converter used by the Kaweco, which you must purchase separately and which holds less ink.  However the nib itself, at least on the pen I received, is severely scratchy, collecting bits of scratched off paper that must be cleaned off every few minutes, nothing at all like the excellent silky smooth nib on the Kaweco pen.  Granted, the German-made Kaweco sells for four times what this sells for, but the nib is the most important component on a fountain pen, and also the most likely to have problems and to reflect production flaws.  If you don't care about a severely scratchy nib this pen is great.  But if you do care about the nib, this pen is problematic.  Just know what you're getting.

Previously I had been keeping them on separate straps, but I felt ridiculous with both of them.  I saw someone at work with one of these, though, and bought this right away.\n\nThe main thing that concerned me was the fact that it doesn't look like there's very much holding the cards in.  Also, there's one open side, so I was a little nervous the cards would slide out.  However, the edges are pretty strong, and the cards are held in snugly on both sides.  There's a tiny lip, so they don't slide smoothly, but it holds them in better that way, and I liked that.\n\nI like the fact that they slide in two different ways, it allows me to know which side is which without looking.  Also, the side where the card slides in from the side instead of the top allows the card a little space, so it worked with the card reader without having to slide the card out.  The other side you have to partially remove the card to make it work, but it can stay 60% in the holder.\n\nI also love the purple color.

The \"little woman\" of the house is a serious crafter. She makes all our greeting cards, scrapbooks and her own gift tags. When we spotted this product, she was all over it. Here are her notes regarding the Avery Astrobrights Easy Peel Full Sheet Labels after a few days of experimentation:\n\nFirst, the color selection is really fun. Having worked in three different print shops, I can tell you these are the same as five of the most popular Astrobright colors by Neenah: Pulsar Pink, Cosmic Orange, Solar Yellow, Terra Green and Lunar Blue. In layman's terms, they are hot pink, neon orange, sunflower yellow, lime and cyan.\n\nSecond, the adhesive is phenomenal. You just barely touch it to a porous surface, and it's there to stay.\n\nThird, the versatility of this product is limited mostly by your imagination. This is not waterproof, so it's not going to work for outside applications or on surfaces that are handled a lot. However, these labels are great for decorating notebooks; file folders; scrapbook pages; greeting cards; envelopes; gift bags, boxes or wrap; storage containers (that won't need to be washed); shelves; books, etc. As a former school paraprofessional, I can tell you what a boon this can be for school teachers, librarians and support personnel. These labels can be used to print bookplates for kids to personalize, label unit study stations, make desk tags, reward stickers, etc. If you use a whole sheet at a time, you can even print signs--something that would make them helpful in a retail or recreational setting, as well.\n\nFourth, they are easy to cut out. I used decorative-edged scissors for a lot of them. Some were a bit problematic close to an already cut edge; however, most cut smoothly and crisply with these or regular scissors. They also work great with punches. For example, I wanted a bunch of colored stars for one project, and just used the scraps of un-printed paper left over from my projects to punch them out of. I don't have a Cricut Cutter or a die-cut press, but I am sure these would work great, as well.\n\nTo make the most of your investment, here are a few things to bear in mind when using these labels:\n\nFirst, you are going to need enough material to fill an entire sheet. Once you print and start cutting these sheets, you can't run them back through the printer. You need to plan your layout carefully to maximize space, and then print them out. I highly recommend Microsoft's Publisher program, because it lets you very precisely place text, graphics and shapes exactly where you want them.\n\nSecond, make sure you have fingernails when you use them. The backing on these labels is not easy to remove, once you have cut or punched them. Due to the stickiness of the paper, you definitely do NOT want to peel the backing before you cut. You need sturdy fingernails to tease the backing off and peel it to affix the stickers. I suppose you could use a plastic blade or a letter opener, but I'd be worried about damaging the sticker that way.\n\nThird, I suggest that you lay out your project with the backing still attached, and then peel and stick, when you know how you want it all placed. Otherwise, you are going to have to print and cut out that piece again--and possibly start over completely. As mentioned before, this adhesive is exceptional and won't come undone without taking parts of what it's stuck to with it.\n\nJust a few odds and ends to add:\n\nFirst, these labels are not cheap. At 10 for $12-14, you're easily paying well over a dollar a sheet for each page.\n\nSecond, as with every other Avery product, the manufacturer offers online and in-the-cloud templates and other tantalizing goodies. However, they are no longer downloadable; it all stays up \"in the Cloud.\" It's fine to go there for ideas, but you are better off designing your own pages in a word-processing or publishing program where you can maintain complete control over your projects, rather than have them floating somewhere in cyberspace. The interfaces at Avery's site are not always user friendly, either. Save yourself some time and use your imagination, instead.\n\nThird, in addition to the Astrobright selection, Avery also offers other color options. The most economical is the white 20-pack for less than $10. I would love to see them offer all of these in bigger quantities--especially for super-crafty people, for educational or commercial applications.\n\nIn conclusion, whether you are a crafts person, educator, retailer, organizer or whatever, these labels are a great resource. It takes serious commitment to pay the asking price. But, if you plan your printing and application carefully, I think you will be pleased with the results!", "summary": "Super-fun print-ready sheets that stick to almost any indoor surface", "unixReviewTime": 1515542400}

I then add and/subtract stars based on certain criteria as listed below.\n1. If an item is exactly what I expected and nothing more it will receive a four star rating\n2. If an item surpasses my expectations it will gain a star\n3. If an item goes slightly below my expectations it will lose a star\n4. If the instructions for the product (if needed) are poorly written (hard to understand due to language issues or grammar) or just too hard to follow it will lose a star no matter if the product meets or exceed my expectations\n5. If a product is significantly below my expectations I will deduct two stars\n6. It will be rare that I would give a product one star since I buy mostly items that have a 4+ rating but in rare instances there may be a good reason that even a four star product gets a one star rating from me.

The sound quality of the speaker isn't bad. As a matter of fact, it is clear, even when playing bass heavy music.\n You can easily print photos from your phone.\n You can use the USB port to charge your phone or access documents on a USB.\n You can use the Bluetooth, wifi connection or the USB port to connect your phone and print.\n You can scan documents or photos with your phone and print.\n\nCONS\n It takes a minute (ok several minutes) to print photos (especially if they are in color).\n Because the printer is compact, there isn't enough room for a digital display. There are very simple buttons across the top.\nIn conclusion, for the price, this all-in-one printer is a steal. Why? In a nutshell it is versatile. You can print, scan and listen to music.

The wood casings do not sharpen well with manuel, hand-held sharpeners even if the sharpener is new. They just tend to chip and break. Also, the barrel colors do not match the lead in a lot of them.
