I did get bored watching seasons 3 through 5 of Pee-Wee's Playhouse though.\n\nIf you're looking for something more mature you might like a couple of space race shows. I spent a month on a space race binge. First I read Space by James A. Michener. Then I watched two movies, The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), and then two great series, From Earth to the Moon (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015). Theyre a great combination.\n\nIf the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.\n\nOther shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.\n\nIf you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.", "summary": "The discs play fine.

They also find out that Admiral Marcus(Peter Weller) is in cahoots with Khan. Admiral Marcus is armed with the U.S.S. Vengeance, a scary looking starship. The film starts out on a fun note with a primitive race of people drawing the Starship Enterprise in the dirt and the editor dissolves into a shot of the Starship Enterprise going into warp speed. Holy cow! Alice Eve looks hot and sexy as a young Carol Marcus. For cheap laughs, Kirk stares at her as she's half nude!  There's a cool scene where the Enterprise spins out of control in space; you can see Kirk and Scotty run up the sides of walls. The scene where \"Spock dies\" is shamelessly rehashed in the film. Kirk and Carol use the\n\"S word\" a lot in the PG-13 version of the movie. Now, pass the flipping salt! J.J.

I have been hooked since it first aired. I have watched every season at least twice! It has inspired me to look into some of the history behind the characters that they portray. Though I try to only read up to a point and then stop. I don't want to ruin things like I did with Ragnar. Sadly, I knew his fate by season 2 after I read a bunch about him.\nWhile I understand artistic license and that some of the history has been lost over the years, passed down in only fables and myths, it still saddens me to see how they treated some of the characters and their story in Season 5. I will not include any spoilers, or at least try not to, but the stuff with Aethelwulf, Aethelred and Albert. Seems, most of the Viking incursions actually happened closer to Aethelred's time, not Aethelwulf's. But I am not an expert in History, and have seen many counter arguments by Historians alone.\nSeason 5 just seemed a little....rushed is all. I loved the way they did the 10th episode and the solo vignettes among the Chaos was amazing. But I would have liked to see some pause in the fighting so the soldiers could watch the leaders duel, but that's just a personal like to that kinda fight. All in all, Vikings is an amazing show, but you can tell that it is trying to wrap up quickly. I would imagine Season 5, part 2 is going to be it.

Well, not completely, anyway. It does carry a lot of the director's favorite themes, from the tortured genius who only needs the chance to prove himself to the war-hungry soldier on a suicide mission, the overbearing government suits and the eccentric, ignored true believers. Those over-simplifications are glaring, of course, but at least there's an effort put in to expand certain characters beyond their stereotype (Kurt Russell's lingering resentment of guns, for example) and the plot itself is rich and interesting enough to paper over most of the holes. I've always had an affinity for science fiction and Egyptian history, so any merger of the two was bound to hit a sweet spot for me, and in this case the marriage works shockingly well. There's a certain other-worldliness about the pyramids, and that particular culture's system of beliefs, which lends itself well to such genre-driven filmmaking. The practical special effects come off wonderfully - gigantic hovering spacecraft and robotic Anubis-helmed enforcers - but it was still a bit early to rely on CG for this type of work and the few instances where they tried don't hold up very well. Despite a phoned-in leading performance by James Spader, Stargate remains a quirky, unexpectedly engaging ride. Still fresh, unique and interesting as it approaches its twenty-fifth anniversary.", "summary": "Respectable, Original Sci-Fi From an Unlikely Source", "unixReviewTime": 1520985600}

Franco who was being backed by Nazi Germany. Ernest Hemingway narrates this documentary, which lasts just over 53-minutes. At that short of a running time you know not every aspect of this legendary battle is going to be talked about so if you're needing a history lesson then this here probably isn't going to be for you. We really don't learn too much about how this battle got started and of course there's no conclusion but THE Spanish EARTH remains rather interesting simply because of the images and the heart behind the storytelling. There's no question that the production company and director Ivens wanted to stand up against those they felt were doing evil things against human beings only wanting to put food on the table for their children. There are many striking visuals where we see people waiting in line for food, which of course runs out before everyone could be fed. We get images of the young men going off to war to fight and of course with war comes the images of many who lost their lives. The production is rather crude as the cinematography isn't all that impressive and there are many issues with the sound but this really doesn't take away from the film and in many ways it makes it even more raw. What I was most impressed with where the images that really put us in the middle of this battle and one of the most striking happens at a bread line where we see that even bread has been stamped so that the poor knows who it belongs to.

Jones", "reviewText": "Despite the directors' claims to the contrary on the special features, The Horde has George Romero's finger-prints all over it--which isn't a bad thing. We get no explanation about the zombie epidemic other than what characters are watching on garbled TV newscasts. The group of besieged humans is assorted conveniently and demographically by race, sex, and criminal background. It would make more sense for the splintered group to cooperate, but their petty differences continue to plague them throughout the movie. They at point capture and torture a zombie so much that you wonder who's more lacking in humanity--the virus-plagued zombie or the humans who don't have an excuse for their behavior. All of this adds up to a bracing dose of intelligence that will satisfy the zombie purist.\n\nWhat's different here is that the directors have jazzed up their material that might remind you of Reservoir Dogs and other low-rent American crime movies. The whiplash editing in the movie's first 20 minutes and its cranked up sound design took me a few minutes to adjust to. The lead black actor has an intended similarity to Samuel Jackson. He's the movie's super-cool no-nonsense conscience.\n\nSo the movie has lots going for it--slam-bang action with social commentary at the core. The movie features fast-moving zombies--which is perhaps its main divergence from the Romero tradition.\n\nI can't give it 5 stars only because it doesn't really break new ground. Its borrowings from American crime cinema are more of a gimmick than a meaningful contribution to zombie flicks. And all of that bang-bang rapid editing is too jarring--it's all just camouflage to disguise the lack of true innovation or (like 28 Days Later) true visual elegance. But zombie aficionados will find the movie satisfying and enjoyable, but nothing extraordinary.", "summary": "Follows the Romero Tradition, Borrows Somewhat From American Crime Movies", "unixReviewTime": 1524960000}

Which is, I suppose, to be expected when amateurs are writing them.\n\nOne of the reviews here mentions that it has a cast of prominent \"B actors\"\n\nBy this they mean Academy Award winning actors like\nMartin Landau and Christopher Plummer.\n\nThen there's Chris Lemmon. \"As an action hero?\" some say. \"Then you're in trouble.\"\nAre we, though? He's done it before.\nIn the film THUNDER IN PARADISE (1993)\nReprising his role from the film in the TV series of the same name: in 1994 and in the two sequels 1994 and 1995 (also providing his voice for the game in that same year).\nIn 1997 he showed up in the first entry of what became a fairly popular franchise \"Wishmaster\".\n\nNo this is a pretty decent series of A and A-minus actors to start us off.\n\nThe story is a little hokey by today's standards I suppose. Redemption stories kind of always were. In this case Lemmon's job is first to destroy Ivan \"The Cyborg\" but changes when he discovers that Ivan was once human and is beginning to remember his humanity.\nYeah, I know. Hokey as hell, right?\n\nAnd the special effects...pretty bad by the standards of 2018. And not great, given that this film came out the same year as TERMINATOR 2.\nBut not every film gets greenlighted for the kind of budget James Cameron gets handed.\nTERMINATOR 2 had a budget of $102,000,000\nFIREHEAD had one of...well, let's just say a LOT less.\n\nAnd when you have almost no budget you do what you can (especially as actors) and sort of hope for the best.\n(Compare the performances in 1957's THE GIANT CLAW with the special effects and you'll see what I mean<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Giant-Claw/dp/B0001DA0UG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Giant Claw</a>\n\nTaking all this into consideration.

She was famous for being famous. Smith lived life in the fast lane. She had a lousy reality show. She had a part as a femme fatale in Naked Gun 33 1/3(1994). She passed away in early 2007. For a B-movie, Skyscraper has some suspense and some real, quality pyrotechnics. There is no computer generated imagery in the film. Today's B and Z grade movies are willing to use CGI. There is a gratuitous sex scene early in the film; we get to see Smith nude in the shower. Anna Nicole Smith was a \"skyscraper\". Smith's real life son played a hostage in the film.

Now why would you go and do that?\n\nNaturally, our vacationing explorers ignore the stereotypical harbinger and proceed to their ill-fated destination despite the fact that the two girls in the group find his creepy warnings more than a tad compelling.\n\nWritten and directed by Chris Sun (Boar), this Aussie Texas Chainsaw-ish movie is as troped as it is gory. It opens hard and brutal, then slowly drags for an hour of insufferably weak dialogue and exposition before releasing the Australian Kraken for the final (and thankfully exciting) third act. Its not unlike Hatchet II (2010) and Victor Crowley (2017), in terms of pacing.\n\nFlashbacks illustrate Charlie (Nathan Jones; Boar, Mad Max: Fury Road) as a child, his messed-up father John (Bill Mosely, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, House of 1000 Corpses, House), and the environment that reared his monstrous psychopathy. Such a childhood would easily yield a Leatherface or Victor Crowley, without a doubt.\n\nAs Charlie Nathan Jones is immense, working in the films favor. And, although the intensity of his presence has a short shelf life on screen, the head crushing, penis-slicing and force-feeding, lower jaw-ripping, and some nudity keep things rather lively.\n\nAt some point a concerned parent (of these twenty or thirty-somethings) heads out to look for them. Its a nice role for Kane Hodder (Smothered, Death House Hatchet 1-4, Friday the 13th parts VII-X), and the Hodder-Jones fight more than a little satisfying even if the action lacked splendid choreography.\n\nThe movie strangely ends right on a kill. I guess they couldn't be troubled to try and wrap it up. Or perhaps that was just another simple chapter in Charlies tourist-slaughtering Summer. But overall this was dumb gory fun, it was cool seeing Nathan Jones using his immense size to play a monster, and I enjoyed it for what it was.

It revolves around some people trying to survive this night with the dead walking around. Sometimes they're outside and other times they're inside. There's no scenery worth mentioning or any effective atmosphere. The acting varies, and I don't think many will like the directing. It just relies on violence and gore. It says it's the unrated version, but there's no nudity. I also don't know if there's any added gore compared to the version that aired on the SYFY channel. The SYFY channel is lenient with showing the blood and guts with these types of films, so don't think it isn't gory simply because it was made for that TV channel.

Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.", "reviewText": "This was a Four Star film in my opinion but the hour long documentary boosted it by half a Star. The beginning shows you how racist America was towards Mexican Americans. The so-called \"Greatest Generation\" was the most racist of generations. Seeing what airmen, marines, sailors and soldiers did to Mexican Americans during the Zoot Suit Riots sets my guts afire. It has me rethink the so-called \"honor\" of the American forces and their generation. thugs in uniforms is what they all were. They may have been no different than the Nazis & Fascists!\n\nWhile this film subject matter had been covered before in other films it had never been detailed from the Mexican American point of view. Kudos to Mr. Edward James Olmos. He pulled things off very well. Janet Maslin said the film was dark, slow and solemn. Violent as it is, American Me is seldom dramatic enough to bring its material to life. She's right about that. However, the film does convey its message enough for the viewer  to learn about Mexican Barrios. Without being preachy or pedantic, Olmos's film pulls this off and shows us how the gangs in East L.A. are merciless--even to those within their ranks.\n\nI look at this movie and realize that that could have been me coming up as a kid had I come up in the barrio. You gotta be tough in the 'hood because if you are not you will be considered a \"punk\" and any and everyone will walk all over you. This is where I realize how women have it so much easier than men. They never have to join gangs and there is never any pressure on them to be \"tough\". Machismo exists only for men.\n\nUnfortunately for Santana he gains wisdom too late and is slain by members of his gang. Buy this film and you will like it. I want to recommend some other films like this. Colors, a Robert Duvall film discusses gangs in detail. The Warriors is another film that details gang life from the East Coast, however. As an extra, see the 21-Jumpstreet Episodes: Loc'd Out. It will show you the gangs Seattle style.\n\nI'm the 277th person to Rate this fine film. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.\n\nA.

The set is awesome. The ghosts are freaking creepy as is that house. But something was missing. There was shock and horror, but there was little connection between the characters. I think the directing was too fast, the actors weren't allowed to find the heart of their characters. And I get that the music was supposed to be some kind of throw back to Gothic drama, but it really overpowered everything else with it's over-the-top cheesiness. Also, I was thrown when the male lead gave Mr. Rochester's speech from Jane Eyre. Was it supposed to be clever, to say that speech to the actress who played Jane Eyre? It completely distracted me from what was happening in the scene. Although, it occurs to me now that might have been deliberate, to highlight how phony he was.. OK, that is kind of clever.\n\nOverall, I think the female lead was poorly written. The actress gave it her best, and she is very good, but she had too little to work with. She seldom reacted to things like a real person would. Coughing up blood? Huh. Weird wells full of blood-colored goop in the basement, with metal covers locked over them? The English and their peculiar ways. And though the house if fun, it goes beyond realistic. Especially her reaction to it. Which was basically no reaction. A hole in the roof? Blood colored stains on all the walls, rotting and dilapidated objects all over the place? For a woman of her up-bringing? Whatever. It's fine. Look, a dog!\n\nI believe this movie is a victim of the current poor writing trend.

The cgi and costumes were great, even for having to depict a story that was set to take place in 1985.  Morally, I think people can understand God by watching to the end.  There is no condemnation, nor consent.  The end is what happened, and all will continue on.  Certain events are necessary and man is not kind.  Though the actual Gospel of Jesus Christ is never mentioned, that is why a feeling of hopelessness and despair can arise over people as the credits role out.\n\nFor the non-serious part of this review - Dr. Manhattan's CGI body is a replica of the late physique athlete and men's model: Gregg Plitt.

Should have played up the \"Best Seller\"angle as the story was taken from the very successful Hammond Innis adventure novel.\n\nSet in the oil fields of Alberta, Canada, it was actually filmed in Italy and the UK simply because travel costs were too high and--I suspect--very few people in Canada had the experience to provide film crews. Unlike today, where all sorts of film crews (and CGI gangs) are busy in Ontario, Alberta and BC on a constant basis.

No one seems to be sad about it though with all the Marvel movies occupying the silver screens and all.  So, I thought I'd go back in time and watch a romantic movie that I'd heard of but never got around to watching.  The trailer looked awesome and the movie wasn't bad at all.\n\nThe plot is predictable.  But, most romantic movies are predictable and you don't watch a romance movie for twist and turns of a plot.  You watch it to watch the romance blossom and the chemistry and how the movie makes you daydream of ideal romance that is not really true in real life.  (But may be partly true).\n\nThe chemistry between the two main actors is beautiful and they have chosen an appropriate actor to play the \"older\" man.  If you're gonna have an affair with an older man, it has to be convincing enough and who is more convincing than Richard Gere?  Who wouldn't want to have an affair with him.  And Wynona Ryder also holds her own as the younger lover who sweeps this wealthy man off of his feet.  She is innocent and sweet yet has enough charm to be believable in winning Gere's heart.\n\nI thought the beginning of the movie was great and then the plot kinda slowed down a little, but the chemistry between the two actors kept me watching.  I wish there was a more distinct arch to the characters and may be show off Autumn in New York a little bit more cuz I don't think they did that enough - may be I had too high of an expectation given the title of the movie.\n\nI don't know if I'd recommend it to people but it satisfied my romance movie itch...so 3.5 stars from me.", "summary": "Sweet Movie!", "unixReviewTime": 1522454400}

I really was enjoying this movie for what it was at this point. Instead we get diverted as star Ian Ziering (who initially makes it seem like the trashy, but good hearted fun of the original 90210) goes to pick up his incredibly irritating and badly acted family, and their whiny McMansion after school special problems. An amusing appearance by the late, and underrated John Heard as a dedicated, lecherous barfly/old surfer, who dozes through the escape and thinks he is dreaming, is unfortunately cut short for, among other things, Tara Reid as the ex wife, who weakly recites her needlessly brittle lines, eyes glazed, as if she is sleep walking. Worse are the children: the messy haired, heavily made up daughter literally stalls their escape efforts to jealously pout and make everything about her. Honestly. And the overly confident son, who since he is away at pilot school, gets the brilliant idea to deal with the sharknado by bombing L.A. (They happen to have bombs at flight school, ready to drop on Angelenos for some reason. How this might stop the tornado part of the problem isn't explained. LOL)  They kill off a likable Tasmanian character, who actually seems manly and tough, for this arrogant kid.  Now this deserves a MST3K or Rifftrax commentary.\n\nAnd just my pet peeve: I hate unrealistic movies that don't have the guts not to have a perfect happy ending. If things are just going to work out anyway, where is the suspense? No problem with camp, but this movie ends with two of the main characters being cut out and escaping bloody from a shark after being swallowed. Groan.

What made Carpenters' version wonderfully unique was the VERY FACT THAT THERE WERE NO WOMEN, nor \"love interests\" as a cliche.

Of course Hollywood, with no more attempt at originality, but to just continue to make super hero movies and remakes will infiltrate a great film like the ORIGINAL THE THING, which is now a landmark and try to throw in non inspired non creative additions like ...\"...Lets bring in a chick and make her the BOSS!...Yeah, that's it... My daughter and her friends will love it and so will other american girls, they'll pay to watch it and we'll make lots of money...!!!\" No, on the contrary, the little entertainment that is in this silly prequel is because of the source writing of the ORIGINAL and the embedded unease of \"someone is not who you think they are.\" Its a great premise. This film, that is contaminated with \"hey girls rock too\" mumbo jumbo doesn't belong in what they thought would be a franchise but was killed because of this monstrous joke. Whether girls \"rock\" or not has nothing to do with an original idea of Grizzled bearded, wearied men who look similar to each other entangled in the universal theme of ever increasing paranoia being preeminent. GENDER WARS AND GENDER POLITICS ruins great movies every time. And SANK THIS MOVIE. That a lowly digital special effects.", "summary": "your contrived gender silliness doesn't make for good action.

SWAMP THING--THE SERIES, after all, had turned out to be one of my favorite and most anticipated viewing experiences, despite some of the quirky plotting that was done during the series' run (that ultimately made me question just exactly what it was that the writers of this show were smoking), and after it was finally over I had the feeling that the show was over before its time. After recently discovering that the show was supposed to have ran for 100 episodes (instead of the meager 72 shows that we now have in this nice new DVD set) I decided to go back and re-watch the episodes this year. If you have read my extensive reviews of volumes one and two previously published here on Amazon, you already have a general sense of how I feel about the show's content, so below I will offer you some insights about this particular DVD set. Things begin near the middle of season three (which we were already well into by the time the second DVD box set ended), so what we have here is the conclusion to the third season. The DVD transfers included here are excellent, and the sound is a quite good overall. We get four DVDs included in this set, with six episodes included upon each disc. The DVD case is a clear plastic standard box, with the DVDs held inside by a snap-in disc holder that can be turned back and forth inside of the box. The cover art is quite good, and the DVD insert sleeve is a double-sided offering with each episode listed on the inside of the insert sleeve (which you can view through the clear case itself once the box is opened), but the episode titles are not included on the DVDs themselves (which is the same presentation as the older discs). The disc menus are similar to the other discs in this series of DVD releases, which allows viewers to select each individual episode (no chapter headings included here since the episodes themselves are only twenty-two minutes in length per title). Overall, the third season is not nearly as memorable as the previous two seasons were, but the episodes themselves are just as entertaining. If you are in a blue mood and need a change, this series will have you turning green in no time. Also, a viewer should be aware that the following episodes are collected here in the order that they were initially supposed to have been sequenced in terms of the overarching narrative (not that we can truly follow the bricolage-wielding style of these series writers anyway!) and NOT in the order that they first appeared back on the USA channel in the early 90's.\nThe conclusion of the third season begins with an episode entitled \"Lesser of Two Evils,\" in which Tyne Daly guest stars as a ruthless business tycoon who pushes the ever-vengeful Anton Arcane out of his place at his industrial plant and becomes Swampy's newest worry. Daly, of course, manages to steal the show, but for my taste this episode is yet another \"wedge-in-the-doorway\" entry which only serves to distract us from the main narrative arc of the previous shows. \"Revelations\" follows Graham and his cohorts into the swamp to hunt down Alec and destroy him, but we are also concerned about Tressa Kipp being left alone with a wounded visitor who may know more about the swamp than he appears to at first. \"Future Tense\" gives us a vision of how the swamp will be compromised by bad chemicals in the future. \"Hide in the Night\" finds the narcissistic Arcane managing to turn himself into some type of bat-looking creature, and of course it falls upon Swamp Thing to help stop his path of destruction. This episode has an intriguing premise, but it quickly degenerates into a B-movie finish. \"Pay Day\" finds three prison escapees hoping to use the swamp as a hideaway before the authorities catch up to them, but Swamp Thing has a few moral lessons to offer the thieves. \"The Return of LaRoche\" begins with Anton Arcane getting smacked around in his bedroom at night (in his black underwear, no less, presumably because there were also a lot of female viewers of this show) by a man whom he believes is Carter LaRoche (one of his arch nemeses) but the catch is that Carter is attempting to try some hypnotic trickery upon everyone's favorite tour guide...Will Kipp! This episode bespeaks the kind of quirky plotting that I miss so much about lesser television programs, as the show begins in a somewhat creepy manner and then just gets more involving from there. Unfortunately, it is yet another mystery that is wrapped up in about twenty minutes time. The episode entitled \"Rites of Passage\" involves Will getting a bit testy with two Valley Girl squealers who have come to the jungle in the hopes that they can perform some type of mysterious ritual that will help them achieve their future goals (since they sound like spoiled rich girls with genetically pre-mapped futures, it is hard to imagine what else they could both possibly want out of this life!)--but Swampy knows that the ritual will do more harm than good. The episode entitled \"Never Alone\" features the great character actor Ray Wise as a wounded man who shows up on Tressa Kipp's doorstep for help, and before long Tressa is beginning to wonder if the man is actually making up stories about his past upon an alien planet! Of course, Wise's character has already had a run-in with Alec, and the conflict that develops here is most interesting, with a finish that is rather touching (if not all that unexpected--this is a \"Sky Fi\" show, remember?). In \"A Most Bitter Pill,\" we get to watch the skilled thespian that is Mark Lindsay Chapman go through his monologue spewing stint while trapped inside of an oxygen-drained cave with a wounded Swampy lying in the background (it's no secret where the remaining oxygen went by the episode's conclusion). The monologue itself runs the gamut from the blasphemous to the self-effacing, and this particular Hamlet-esque entry only serves to reiterate my point that a less talented actor might have served the role of Arcane better in this particular series (but I am not taking anything away from Chapman's acting abilities, mind you, I just can't help but wonder if maybe he thought that this show might have been beneath his own versatile capabilities). I won't dare disclose the ending of this one! In any case, it was nice that Tom Blomquist offered Chapman the opportunity to do a solo episode, as the results are quite memorable overall. In \"The Curse,\" a creepy looking mummy appears out of nowhere (while still in his tomb) in the swamp--I know, it's incredible, stop chortling--and ol' Swampy has to have a conversation with him to help talk him out of revenging himself upon a nearby foe. This is not a bad episode really, but it reminds me of the same kind of over-the-top theatrics that were employed in the episode \"This Old House of Mayan\" (that title still makes me guffaw out loud), and in the end it's just too incredible, even for a show like this. In \"Judgment Day,\" Will winds up in the wrong place at the wrong time (a diner on the edge of town--sound familiar?) and is inadvertently framed for the murder of his cute girlfriend's father (wouldn't you know it?). I mean, where does Will find these chicks?! Anyway, one thing that always bothered me about Will's character is that he is a pretty decent guy and after a time one might think that the town's people would come to accept this (even despite Will's own reform school background), but no. In each episode, Will is guilty until proven innocent, or at least that is how the antagonistic townspeople seem to view him. Anyway, this episode draws you in with its mysterious setup, and remains gripping until the end when Swamp Thing has to offer Will a few of his own private detective skills to help find the real culprit. In \"Eye of the Storm\" (an episode written by someone named Brenda Lilly--a pseudonym, perhaps?), Tressa's sister returns to Houma after a long period of not having contacted her (beautiful) sister of the marsh, and eventually a complicated plot unfolds having to do with the lady's (now deceased) husband and some documents that some baddies desperately want back. Even though we finally hear an update about the Jim Kipp case in this particular episode, it is glossed over much too matter-of-factly, and the espionage-style of this particular episode again pushes us into a realm of storytelling that we hadn't quite expected. Still, this is a very entertaining entry overall. \"Vendetta\" features the gorgeous Peggy O'Neal as General Sunderland's (sexy) daughter, who turns up at Arcane's insidious fear factory (under an alias) with the intention of meting out some righteous vengeance upon Anton (but things don't quite go as planned). The lovely Blake Pickett is the star of the episode entitled \"The Burning Times,\" in which she plays a burned-on-the-behind witch (here come the proverbial occult themes again, look out) out to prove to Will Kipp that she \"knew him\" in a past life (and after Will gets a look at her he is pretty much willing to believe anything she says...and, honestly, I don't blame him!). This story is pretty formulaic overall, but we are here for the actors and the swamp monster, so why carp? \"The Specter of Death\" finds a noisy spirit going after Graham and Arcane in their laboratory, but the spirit may turn out to be someone who Arcane knows all too well. In \"Cross-Fired,\" writers Bruce Cervi and John Lansing offer Mark Lindsay Chapman yet another chance to stretch his acting abilities, and this time he ends up changing personalities with Alec, which makes the mad doctor into a much nicer guy for a time--and eventually endears him to Tressa Kipp, who has now begun to develop some feelings for the man she has so often despised. Unfortunately, Swamp Thing has now begun to fulfill the role of evil that Arcane has left behind. This was a fairly good story for so late in the season, and the finish (while not unexpected) is at least finalized with some imagination this time. In \"Patient Zero,\" Alan Bergmann guest stars as an ailing man who wants to know Arcane's secrets but fails to realize just how dangerous that the man is. This one remains interesting due to Arcane's efforts at blowing out Swamp Thing's vocal chords by way of shooting him in the throat! But even this cruel tactic doesn't keep Alec from attempting to help the patient stop a devious plot before his untimely demise. The Biblically-themed episode entitled \"In the Beginning\" (just kidding!) follows Arcane's attempts at creating a plant-robot hybrid...need I go further? Actually, this episode deserves points just because of how darned funny that it actually is. Swamp Thing literally has to convince the robot that he isn't a plant and that he needs to go back home to his laboratory--I'm not kidding. Eventually, after \"Plantbot\" goes berserk and takes out for the swamp on his own, Alec attempts to deck the thing by punching the hunkajunk in the face--I'm not kidding. But, at the very least, we can't say that this episode isn't memorable. \"Brotherly Love\" features the oft-spotted David Rupprecht as a man after Tressa's own heart (boy would I be after her heart!), but Tressa (again making me question just how long it is going to take her to open her, er, arms to a member of the opposite sex again--my God, what did Jim's father do to this poor woman?!) isn't quite ready for a commitment. Unfortunately for beautiful Tressa, Brad Hewett's bro Kurt is back in town, and he wants to teach the nervous-fingered guy a thing or two about portrayal (this episode has one of the most awkwardly rigged pistol-shooting devices that I personally have ever witnessed...then again, I really haven't witnessed that many). Again, this episode only serves to remind us that the series has lost its way in terms of a definable story arc, not that the producers had much time to stew about it. Ahoy, mateys! Grab yer eye-patches and your rapiers because it's time for the episode entitled \"Yo Ho Ho\" (no, this one's not about Will's newest girlfriend). Not only is this episode one of the most unbelievable entries in the series, it is also, conversely, one of the more amusing entries overall. Alec and Will rig up some type of device that can change a boy into a man (talk about pseudo-scientific implausibility!), which certainly helps when a young pirate (at least in his own mind) played by child actor Shane Obedzinski (yes, he was in THE SANDLOT) discovers some nasty doings by Arcane (why did he wonder out to the factory like he did, anyway?) and eventually ends up having to impress his own mother by magically transforming into a grown man (played here by James Zelley) and defeating the persistently wicked Anton in a duel to the death (not really). While it is great fun to watch Chapman demonstrate his swashbuckling skills in the muck-encrusted swampland, the finish to this particular entry is just too absurd to swallow (plus, the swamp seems to attract oddball types who apparently have no business being there but wonder out there anyway for some reason). Well good Lord, even Zeus himself shows up in the episode entitled \"Heart of Stone,\" in which the gods attempt to play a game of chess using the people of the swamp as their pawns. While the premise of this episode is a little more imaginative than most, the subsequent unfolding of events are simply not all that noteworthy or memorable. In \"Romancing Arcane,\" the lovely Kristina Feil turns up in a role as Arcane's newest foxy love interest, but she ends up turning the tables upon the narcissistic dude and a rampage of action scenes quickly ensues (in fact, this episode has very little romance but quite a few chase scenes and almost nonstop action). Again, though, we still have no overarching storyline to cling to emotionally. \"Heart of the Mantis\" is an interesting episode in which Arcane is suspected (even by Swampy) of having killed a gifted scientist who died with secrets that Arcane would practically kill to get ahold of--but it turns out that the lady pretending to be the scientist's grieving daughter (played here by Cheryl Hines) may have plans for those secrets that do not involve Arcane's assistance. This episode is an interesting diversion, for sure, and is somewhat more memorable than the other episodes contained in this box. Our final episode is called \"That's a Wrap,\" and, while it is rather hastily wrapped up, it has several interesting things about it, not the least of which is the appearance of the super sexy Candace Miller (that shot when she leans in to speak to the police investigator...yummy!) in a particularly devious role as a fetching femme fatale with more than a passing interest in Anton. As if Mister Arcane's ego needed more stroking yet, a local TV company has decided to write and produce a film about the scientist's life (I guess they were desperate for material?), which, of course, leads the ever controlling Arcane to monitor the production very closely (with Graham being the one to ultimately get his feelings hurt after his part is unceremoniously cut out of the final shooting script). While several opportunities for meta-fictional satire are clearly missed in this one, it is fun to see what happens during the show's final few minutes, and really they pack quite a lot of information into this one narrative (and we even get to see Swamp Thing take a bullet for dear Tressa--I think Alec is the man that she truly wants, but that's just my theory, hee hee). Swamp Thing waves goodbye to us in this last episode, and when I viewed this seven years ago I waved back at the screen, held in a suspension of wonder as to what more might have been.\nIn my opinion, the swamp that the crew at Universal studios built for this particular series was nothing short of incredible. Each episode actually does succeed at pulling us into the swamp itself, and that is a tribute to all of the set designers who labored away upon this show. In fact, I give applause to everyone who worked on this production, from Dick Durock (doing an incredible interpretation of the Alec Holland character) to the composer of the rustic voodoo-oriented musical theme, Christopher Stone himself (whose score actually captures the mood of the series perfectly). When I waved goodbye to this series many years ago, I came away disappointed. I wanted more, and I expected a more dramatic (and comic book oriented) conclusion. But, for what we have, I do have to say that the show has many talented people's work to recommend it, even if it is a bit off the beaten path as far as most television productions are concerned (especially these days). It is a rather awkward show, but I enjoy it for its non-traditional approach and its quirky thematic qualities. Still, I would have accepted another twenty-eight episodes without hesitation, especially if they had in mind a reunion episode involving the Jim Kipp character. As it is, we are left with more hanging threads than anyone would ever care to thimble, but in the end one can tell that a lot of creative passion went into this series and I feel that (in general, at least) the show has yet to be given its due. As for the Swamp Thing character, I remember reading an online article about an unproduced script of Len Wein's (who is, sadly, no longer with us today) that was floating around Hollywood years ago and I wondered to myself why no one decided to greenlight a NEW Swamp Thing solo theatrical film as of yet. In addition to the green-soaked remake of THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, the revamping of Swamp Thing film franchise is one of the few (and I mean very few) movies that I look forward to seeing made and released one day soon (I hope). With all due respect to Jim Wynorski, THE RETURN OF THE SWAMP THING simply did not get enough of the character right for my taste. Now that Amazon.com is no longer offering this particular item for sale, fans may have to rummage about the dark corners of the Internet in order to catch the conclusion of this much maligned series. While I personally prefer the quiet poetry and the developing story arc of the first season of episodes, there is no denying that SWAMP THING--THE SERIES: Volume Three is pretty good for what it is. And, in my humble estimation at least, it's another keeper. I only wish that some extras would have been included here (my how I would have appreciated some writers commentaries for this one!) but at least we have the episodes in their proper order and with tremendous visual transfers. And remember: \"The swamp is my world! It is who I am...it is what I am. Do not bring your evil here, I warn you! Beware the wrath of...Swamp Thing!\" B- (for the whole shebang)", "summary": "SWAMP THING-THE SERIES Volume Three sends the limited run program off with a nice new DVD video transfer...", "unixReviewTime": 1518480000}

Abigail Adams was very much before her time in terms of her knowledge of political theory, history, and political affairs.  He major role, of course, was to support John, however she was his advisor and counselor as the movie clearly portrays.  \"You are not without counsel\" she reminds him.  I don't recall that quote every appearing in any of the histories I read, but certainly the screen writer was not taking liberties when he put it in the movie.  Their relation was before its time.  Martha Washington, Eliza Hamilton, Dolly Madison all played supportive roles to their husbands, but were never involved in any way in advising of policy decisions or political matters. Abigail was.  The movie captured that and it captured John's great  love for her.  I loved the scene at the end, although it may or may not have actually happened.  \"Posterity will never know what we sacrificed for their freedom\"  That is an accurate portrayal of Adams' career from my studies.  He was a devoted husband, a family man, a strict but instructive father.  He spent ten years in Europe, 7 of them without Abigail. Many times from the Declaration of Independence to his assignments in Europe they were separated and he was separated from his family.  At one point early in his Presidency his letters to her were literally begging her to come to him (Wood's book - Friends Divided). He was isolated, he had a cabinet more loyal to Hamilton than to him, and not only did he get no support from Jefferson - Jefferson through ghost writers and editors of newspapers that he at least partially financially supported trashed Adams mercilessly.  Abigail was his counselor, his source of strength, and his best friend. I thought the movie captured that very well. I think it portrays Adams much under appreciated contributions to our founding very accurately, and very well.  It portrays his personality very accurately.  He was stubbornly independent  - imagine that - a founder of our independence being independent.  He is always listed as a Federalist in our histories - but as the movie accurately shows - he never belonged to a political party and considered them an abomination.  He did align more closely with Hamilton's Federalist ideas and policies - but not totally.  He was never comfortable with a national bank.  He never wanted a standing army -  navy, yes, but not an army.  Hamilton wanted both of these.  He did say \"a mob is still a mob, even if it is with you\", but not in the theatre where Columbia was sung and he received a standing ovation.  So if the acting was so good and the adherence to history was so good, why 4 stars?  Well, many things that were said in the movie are accurate quotes from our founders - but they did not all occur as portrayed.  Washington did say, but not at the moment of Adams inaugural speech 'I am fairly out, and you are fairy in, let us see who will be happier.\"  Jefferson is not portrayed accurately. He had such an aversion to personal confrontation, that almost all of the quotes that are in the movie are accurate, but made through letters to Madison or other of his supporters.  He and Adams never met after that one scene where Adams asks for his support while they are walking together on Market Street. After that they never spoke face to face.  All of Jefferson's opinions came through Madison in his role in the House, or in newspapers under ghost writers names.  Likewise, there was only one meeting between Adams and Hamilton, and it did not contain the great disagreement over policy expressed face to face. Such disagreement is accurate, such animosity and mutual disrespect is accurate, but it occurred in letters, anonymous newspaper articles, and expressions to their individual supporters - not face to face.  I understand the screenwriter has to make it interesting, and the number one complaint of negative reviews is that it nevertheless was boring.  Well, not to those of us who love history, and want history accurately portrayed in movies!  I was not bored.  I am not disappointed in the least.  Just a bit perfectionist in the chronology of  some of those statements, and the context in which they occurred.  Agree, how they were presented did make the movie more interesting.  And for those who complained \"I feel asleep, I was bored\"  Please be asleep in the next election.  You do not deserve the right to vote in a democratic republic for which John Adams and other founders so tirelessly sacrificed.  Everybody should watch this, and should, for God' sake, stay awake and pay attention.  One of the best history movies I have ever seen.", "summary": "... thought the acting by the two main characters was excellent.

She's brilliantly portrayed by Gemma Arterton. The story is Old English & depressing of the times. Tess is depended on way too much by her family for their survival. And of course, Tess is like a rag doll that keeps getting pins stuck in her to make her suffer just about the entire series. I realize this is an older storyline, but why torture her until there is nothing left of her--the most abused & USED & abused character, to torture anymore. And the supposed love of her life, Angel, was a weak-weak-weak man. He's committed sins, yet won't forgive her past that was not even HER sin, but another man's sin. I don't like movies like this with goodie-too-shoes people who condemn the victims of things they cannot control. When Angel, Tess' husband, runs away for about two years he should never have come back. For there is Tess--the rag doll with more pins being stuck through her by even her own family, in sacrificing herself just to appease & give her greedy mother a means of sustenance. None of her family cared anything for Tess. And wasn't it convenient when Tess---yet again--told \"her husband\" to marry her sister & take care of the family, who used her just as much as the other abusers, when her fate was sealed. How the sister smiled & clung to Angel, obviously being thrilled to b provided for when no more Tess existed. In some ways, Tess was not a mentally stable person for just going along with the hard work & abusers. I found it strange that she didn't live in the House of D'Urbervilles home that Angel gave Tess upon marriage. His family would have helped her. Her mother could have worked, because her other children were of school age & the girl marriageable age. None of them made an effort to work. This movie/series is all about abuse, weakness, & stupidity--the way I see it. No more Tess---her immediate family live happily ever after. The series was well adapted, but way too overdone with all the sacrifices Tess made. Didn't that make her a bit off in the head to allow such things, endure hardships when she really should have thought of her own survival.  Yes, I give it two stars for the above reasons. If it had been reality then Tess' sister who would b glad to take her husband, should have been the one to sacrifice. Remember, she did make Tess promise her to not leave her at home---she wanted escape & in the final analysis the sister got her husband & escape too. Enough said.

Satan's armies led by four demon generals are about to take control when a hero throws back Satan's forces. Satan and General Alciel are forced to flee to another world. Where do they end up? Modern Tokyo of course. They find out that their magic doesn't work so our demonic twosome have to find a place to live, get ID cards and earn some cash. What does King Satan do to earn a living? Work at a fast food joint whilst plotting a way to go home. Their idyllic life is distrubed when they find that they've been followed by the hero who plans to stop their plans.\nThis is the story of how heroes and demons cope with modern living. Their are two story arcs which are similar in extent. In my opinion the first story arc is better, better paced and with a more satisfying ending. That's not to say that the last six episodes are bad; they aren't but the first story arc is more interesting.\nThis series has a sly and sarcastic sense oh humour running all the way through it. I enjoyed this aspect but some may not. The script is generally good and the characters are well balanced and plausible given the concept.\nThe animation on the DVD and blu-ray is good. Now here's the bad part. And it's really bad. I first watched this as a stream and then watched the blu-ray and DVD versions. As a stream in Japanese the the sound quality was great. This si not the case on either disc format. The Japanese sound track is okay, not great but okay. The English soundtrack is truly awful. The voice acting is actually reasonable but the sound quality is appalling. The voice actors sound as if they had socks stuffed in their mouths and then were recorded through a wall. This is unacceptably bad sound editing and if you only listened to the English soundtrack thisd would be a real disappointment. I'd say go with the Japanese version with somewhat quirky translations.\nThis reminded me a little bit of \"I couldn't be a hero so I reluctantly decided to get a job (Yu SIbu). There's no fan service in Devil is a Part Timer and it's not missed at all. It's better than Yu Sibu, more consistent and much funnier.

Boy,  that's where I keep all of my stuff which I may need for an immediate emergency.  Then there is the crime scene tech who says she's through and going back to Quantico.  They are in rural Texas, 200 miles from the nearest town with an airport.  Of course the FBI would send a tech from Virginia, a tech who got to the scene before the agents stationed  in Texas.  And Billy Wayne.  What can I say?  Rural doesn't mean dirty, disgusting and disgraceful.  I've spent a lot of time out in the country.  None of my friends, acquaintances and relatives would eat at Billy Wayne's place or socialize with him.  Maybe the local druggies, drunks and criminals might.  But, professionally, I've known a lot of them too.  It may surprise the general public, but many of them have standards which Billy Wayne doesn't meet.\n\nAnd of course there are the victims who become dinosaur chow.  Of course they split up.  Of course they go toward the growling. Of course they ignore warning signs.  One of the silliest scenes is Little Willie in the restroom and a raptor doesnt just shake the door knob, he tries to turn it.  We see this from inside so maybe it's the Rottweiler at the door, but it is the raptor who  enters.  There is probably plenty more but I stopped watching.  In large letters at the beginning of the movie is the legend, \"Uncork'd Entertainment\".

The number of dangerous criminals who get conveniently killed to save the main characters from difficult decisionsthis strikes me as bad writing. Having watched all 7 seasons, Ill take a couple paragraphs to explain how this show never quite makes it to excellent, but remains.. well, medium. But first, spoiler warning:\n\nThe remainder of this review contains mild spoilers.\n\nIm not a person who sits here looking for goofs but this show is pretty sloppy about technical facts, math, and medicine. Off the top of my head, I don't think theres enough municipal $ to pull out a forensics team on every investigation. Sadly, Phoenix probably doesnt even process half of its rape kits. And Im not sure some of these cases would go to the DA? Also, how many of the cases that are processed by the DAs office are overseen by the DA him/herself (rather than ADAs, who have only been mentioned at the very end of the series). But one of the writers figured out that involving the city police more often kind of fixes some implausibility, so most of the issues are minor in later seasons. Examples: I recently watched an episode where someone wanted govt funding and said it would come to 2 cents per person, then the resolution of the show was for govt to grant 60 mil in funding. US pop is not 3 billion, lol. Or the show where they talked about the drug wet, saying it was a powerful hallucinogen but the ingredients are, according to Medium: cigarette, formaldehyde, and alcohols. Pretty sure the hallucinogenic properties come from, idk, a hallucinogen? Again, I don't sit here looking for errors; Im just trying to enjoy the show. But sometimes its like what did they just say???\n\nMy main issue with the show is how nice everyone is. Devalos, especially, is completely lovable and completely unrealistic as a character.  I don't think such a good person has ever made it to public office. (OTOH, Keener was great! Though shes probably a good soul, shes in it for $$ and revenge, which doesnt annoy me so much. Devalos could be the second coming lbh.) Worse yet, everyone is so nice that the show writers are forced to make cringey dei-ex-machina choices; for instance, the ghost of a dead girl uses Bridgette to send an e-mail which gets a potential criminal killed before the main cast is forced to make a decision wherein there is no good choice, but the right choice (which theyd be compelled to make) is patently illogical. Another episode which disappointed me was the one where the Kevorkian-esque doctor, who seems ideologically high-minded and possibly very advanced, suddenly turns out to be this majorly sleazy criminal. How convenient. It would have been interesting if the show which is all about morality actually tackled a moral issue instead of circumnavigating.  The niceness of the show knocks off a full star from my rating, but it also adds half a star, because I guess wholesome TV is harmless? and the staunch idealism of this show is, well, nice. In a way. Still, I almost resent Allisons ability to deal with real-world horror and always rise above? I guess she is blessed, with her family, as the show successfully establishes.  My feeling of frustration with Allisons niceness evaporated after the AU episode where her entire family gets killed: she goes so hard and calculating, its magnificent, and I finally realized that she isn't this sweet, nice person: in a way thats a public face she always wears For Her Kids. That gave me a little shiver, and thenceforth I have been 100% team Allison-is-cool.\n\nSome of the seasons were significantly better than others. I cant distinguish the first three v well because I watched them slowly over months, whereas I chain-watched seasons 4-7 during holidays. Seasons 1 and 2 are okay, though very predictable. Season 3 is probably the worst, and I stopped watching the show for a few months because those episodes were written in somebodys sleep. Season 4, I think, is when the Dubois family starts having some real issues, and it picks up a little. Joes character becomes a lot more plausible after hes held hostage. Then theres Keener, and the plots in the final seasons start to finally acquire some real nuance. Still, these gem episodes are tempered with the same kind of paint-by-numbers episodes that seem like they are supposed to surprise the viewer, but fail. And the only nuance we see in the season arcs has to do with the relative merits of Allison and Joes various employers. Seasons 5 and 6 are the best; Im not a fan of S7 but unlike most reviewers I didn't mind the final episode.\n\nAs Ive already mentioned, I don't think the writing of this show rises above mediocrity for more than a few episodes. I don't know much about acting, but Arquettes acting can sometimes fall a little short of convincing me, lol. (Though I am quite fond of watching her try.) Huston is a different storyincredible talent, and Vassilieva and Cubitt (the actors who played Scanlon and Ariel) I also found tremendously convincing as the series went on. I was pleasantly surprised at how much the show improved between seasons 3 and 5. Scanlon and DiNovis relationship, for me, was a real high point. Overall I found Medium frustrating, but it was endearing enough for me to watch 7 seasons: 3.5 stars, which rounds up :)", "summary": "Review for 7 seasons", "unixReviewTime": 1515024000}

I was approximately in the same age group of their characters when they were on the air  and maybe that is why I found their humor relatable. Even now, though for the most part, I've outgrown some of the overt slapstick-style humor and over the top hijinks, I love this show. If it was any other show, I probably couldn't bear to watch it. Yes, as some reviewers have commented, some of the comedy is silly... But it somehow just feels right coming from these two characters and it's just good fun. I love Dule Hill and James Roday in these roles. I still regard Psych is one of my favorite dramedies of all time. I read the reviews before I purchased this set and I was reluctant to purchase even though it was being offered at a super great price of $43 at the time. That's the cheapest I had ever seen it on Amazon and I really wanted it. That's just a little over 5 bucks per season and I had never seen it cheaper than that. In fact, I had once seen it offered for $199 and as much as I love these guys and this show, I definitely wasn't paying that! But there were so many negative reviews about the quality of the packaging and the quality of the discs themselves. I'm probably about six or seven discs in and I haven't had any problems with skipping or blurriness. (I sure hope I don't start experiencing issues as I go on. If I do, I'll be sure to update my review.) As for the problems that some cited about the quality of the disc case and packaging, I have purchased DVDs of currently popular series like NCIS Los Angeles and Elementary as well as the complete sets of several other shows that are no longer on the air. Some of these have what I consider to be cheaper packaging and more problematic packaging than this. I've had experiences where you have to press that little button that holds the disc in place so hard to release a disc that you're in fear of breaking the disc. I've had instances where the rod that holds the entire library of discs in place just completely became detached from the case and will no longer stay in there firmly. If you open the case too fast, they all go flying out. Trust me, I've had to crawl on my hands and knees and reach under a piece of furniture more than once to retrieve a disc that fell to the floor and rolled away due to this problem. However, I've had no problems with the Psych case. I don't regard it to be that cheap. At least it's no cheaper than any others that I have purchased recently. Overall, I think it's an absolutely great set and I have really enjoyed the opportunity to watch these guys again (along with the rest of the cast). Such great fun! I've even turned on some of the commentary (which is something that I rarely do because it usually bores me to tears) and I have looked at some of the bonus features to get some insight into what the creation of this series was like back then. Pretty interesting. So far (fingers crossed) I am glad that I ignored the negative reviews and made the purchase.", "summary": "Great set...What's with the negative reviews on quality?", "unixReviewTime": 1520294400}

Film Lover", "reviewText": "Okay, finally getting around to writing a review for this set.  I love Jacques Demy and have since I saw The Umbrellas of Cherbourg on its opening day and stayed and saw it two more times (one could do that in those days).  I find there's something to enjoy in almost all of his films, even the later wacky ones.  This Blu-ray set is a bit of a mixed bag and the reason for that I'll make clear in a bit.\n\nMost importantly, Umbrellas looks pretty excellent here - the upgrade from the DVD is pretty very large.  Unfortunately, The Young Girls of Rochefort isn't quite as good - same people restored it, but it's a bit yellower than it should be, which is a shame and it shouldn't be and would have been easy to correct.  But I suspect that in the end Mr. Demy's widow, Ms. Varda approved this - she was responsible for all the DVD transfers, which were horrible on all these films, as well as a theatrical reissue of Young Girls which was one of the most appalling things I've ever had the misfortune of seeing.  I had a 16mm dye transfer Technicolor print of Young Girls and it had the most glorious eye-popping color with NO yellow cast to it.  The other pity here is not to include the English dub for Young Girls - it's very interesting and worthwhile.\n\nThe Bay of Angels transfer really isn't too great, but everything else is fine.  But even with those caveats, the set is a must-have if you love the films of Mr. Demy, who, unlike the filmmakers of La La Land, was a true original.", "summary": "Demy on Blu-ray", "unixReviewTime": 1529712000}

On the verge of getting fired by the owner (Mel Welles), the young man brings his weird hybrid plant to the store to spur business. Unbeknownst to Seymour, it requires flesh & blood to grow and live. Jackie Joseph plays the other worker at the shop and Seymours potential girlfriend. A very young Jack Nicholson appears as a patient at a dentist office for about 8 minutes.\n\nBack when this was released Im sure the black humor was almost scandalous (e.g. Seymour feeding body parts to the ravenous plant), but Corman got away with it because its such an inane comedy. A lot of the humor didn't work for me and I personally don't like black & white. But there are enough amusing elements to make it worth checking out and Jackie possesses a winsome sweetness thats a pleasure to behold. Filmed in late December, 1959, the late 50s/early 60s ambiance is a highlight.\n\nTHE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 12 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles. WRITER: Charles B. Griffith. ADDITIONAL CAST: Toby Michaels and Karyn Kupcinet are on hand as high school girls in need of flowers for a float.\n\nGRADE: C", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2018", "summary": "Silly, quirky B&W black comedy non-horror", "unixReviewTime": 1519084800}

These workouts aren't taxing on your joints but they are NOT easy! I swear in just about 6 workouts, I already feel like I lost inches. My stomach/waist feels more \"zipped up\" my posture has improved, and my lower body is more firm. I'm not sure if this type of workout will result in weight loss, but that's more dependent on how you eat anyway. Like other's have said, her stretches are super quick.
