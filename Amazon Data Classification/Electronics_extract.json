But these earbuds work and actually work pretty well. The over the ear type of headphones work slightly better for noise cancellation but who wants to carry those around all the time. I have thousands of dollars worth of headphones, from several pairs of electrostatic, planar magnetic, to several pairs of $500 ear buds. I even own a separate portable amp and dsp for when I listen to music on my phone. Despite the range and variety, I find myself carrying around the cheap apple headphones 99% of the time just because it's more convenient and I make lots of phone calls. Having said that, I believe this is finally the pair that will do it all for me, well, mostly anyway.\n\nMusicality? Much better than my stock Apple headphones. Not as good as all my other earbuds or headphones but I challenge anyone to discern an appreciable difference surrounded by noisy traffic, people chattering, or the constant hum from the airplane engines. Those are also the situations where the active noise cancelling really shines. And unlike passive noise blocking, you can turn off the noise cancellation instead of removing the ear buds when situations dictate. Besides, am I gonna carry two pairs of ear buds and switch every time I get a phone call? Nope.\n\nComfort? Very comfortable but they do feel a bit loose and protruding to me. For me, the medium tips don't feel like they go deep enough into my ear canal, while the small size tips are visible too small where the stabilizing arm does not securely fill the inside of my ear. However, this may be a plus, as my other ear buds that block out noise passively, have a tight deep fit into my ear canal but can become painful with extended periods of wear.", "summary": "Excellent multi-function, all-around earbuds", "unixReviewTime": 1528761600}

Back in the day a friend had his dads old tube amp and always thought it sound so warm with almost a 3d effect  I'm in my early 60s and when I was younger I remember taking out tubes from our RCA tv,marking them and going to our corner drug store to test them and replace what was bad,replaced tubes flipped on the set and its working again.\n\nNow for the CD3. When I first set it up, I turned it on for about an hour to warm up while I was pulling out my receiver(Onkyo TX-NR808),cd player(Onkyo CD-7030) to add new Monoprice rca cables to replace old ones,also adding the Pangea Audio AC-14 powercord for the receiver and also bought one for the CD3,very nice powercords by the way. Got it all set-up,now for the test. Ive got a few remastered cd,s and I like to use, Supertramps crime of the century for any changes that I do with my equipment. The first track is school and let me say that I heard sounds that I haven't heard since playing vinyl. I could not believe how well you could hear the children and the scream also Rudy with the train moving along on the tracks. I kept getting a smile on my face due to sounds that I had not heard in years. That night I set-up the Grace internet radio on pandora and let it burn in the stock tubes. I did that for a few evenings,then played Jethro tull's Aqualung (Steve Wilson) remaster and what a change. You could hear every breath as Ian plays the flute and It was like every strum on the guitar was right in front of me and that was with the stock tubes and used those for the next few weeks. O and Ive never heard Pandora sound so good.\n\nNow It was time to roll some tubes and see how well it would respond. I ordered a Matched Pair Psvane UK-6SN7 and rolled in the new ones and gave it about a 1/2 hour to warm up. I played Supertramp and what a difference, the bass was so smooth not punchy,great mids and highs are so detailed for a CD.Its been a few weeks since the Psvane went in and Ive since had to adjust the bass down from 3.5 to 0 and the 3d effect is just unreal,coming from only the front stage,the sound is amazing.\n\nNow I know that this was only 200 bucks,but I had been reading about the Shuguang Treasure Cv181-z and went and ordered those and am waiting for them to arrive from china. I know,I know that Ive more into tubes then the buffer's cost...lol but that's the fun about rolling tubes,plus l will have a great set of Psvane tubes when needed again.\n\nSpeakers are Paradigm monitor 5 V.2,Kef iQ 10 and MK sub woofer,that is my front stage.\n\nI cant recommend this enough to folks that want the warmth of tubes with a great change in music.\n\nNow I'm hooked on tubes. I decided to pull out my 70s Sony PS-4300 w/Grado cart and bought yet another Yaqin, MS23B tube phone stage. But that will be a review for another day....O and by the way another great piece to add to your system.\n\nWell I said that I was bit buy the tubes (thanks Gemini Doctor)...lol I just went an ordered another Yaqin,its the MC-50L Push-pull Integrated tube amplifier and should receive it this coming week,thanks to prime. Wife is going to kill me,but o well, only live once right.\n\nIve got a 70s pioneer SG-9500 EQ that I'm going to use to set tone control, since the Integrated Amp has none. Cant wait to take a listen, once its hooked up and set the bias on the tubes. Using this amp for music only and the Onkyo for my OPPO and TV.\n\nThank you Gemini Doctor for bring in Yaqin products. Any chance that you may carry the Yaqin DAC-K9 J ???\n\nI must say that I'm very impressed with the quality and sound so far with the 2 pcs from Yaqin and cant wait to try the new MC-50L.  .. .", "summary": "Im Hooked", "unixReviewTime": 1524268800}

Two other headphones I tried had all the controls next to each other and it was hard to tell which one I was pushing.\n\nI can't read or concentrate when people around me are talking, so I'll be glad to have these with me when I go to camp this Summer, to block out the conversations when I'm off duty ad want to read.

The keyboard itself without light makes sense because it types pretty well, and can reduce the use of battery when typing a lot. So far I think this is the best keyboard case in the market because the price is high value for money with such quality, and it easily beats the Apple Smart Keyboard that can be purchased for iPad Pro 10.5\". Personally, I am very picky about iPad Cases and Keyboard Cases, this can simply deliver high value. It would be very nice if this keyboard case can have silver colour, dark blue or any other colours. Also the EC Technology Logo should be improved, and should not be printed on the keyboard which can cheapen the image of this keyboard case. But durability certainly is one of my concerns for this keyboard case, as well as easily get dusty on the surface of the keyboard case.

These are cheap, and they sound like it. They are just OK, and that's fine. They sound better than any laptop speakers I've ever heard, but anything but the most basic computer speakers will probably sound better. That said, I've used a few different cheap soundbars and bluetooth speakers with line in, and these sound as good or better than most of that, so... I'd compare them to an average TV or something as far as sound quality goes. They are not very rich or full, but they are loud enough and are not real tinny sounding, even when turned up to high volumes they still sound good and don't get distorted. Overall I'm happy with them, they fit my needs and the price was right. I'd buy them again, but not for my desktop in the house where I play the occasional game or watch a movie from time to time, I'd want something better for that.", "summary": "Even though I have a perfectly good sound card in the machine", "unixReviewTime": 1517875200}

It is just the right size for my desk as I am using it for my rebuilt eMachines ET-1831 computer.  I needed a little smaller keyboard due to limited space, and the length of this board is 3 inches less than my full sized Logitech keyboard which I use with my primary computer.  It's wireless which I really needed, the keys are pretty quiet and well spaced, it's heavy enough to stay put in one place aided by the rubber non-skid feet, and it came with brand new Duracell batteries installed which was nice for a refurbished (like new) keyboard.  The batteries are supposed to last 3 years and they just might do that as my older wireless Logitech TV keyboard will go over 2 years on fresh batteries.  Personally, I'm not a big fan of the gloss black finish as I would have preferred a flat black or slightly rough finish, but for this price I feel that it was an excellent deal.  And yes, the Logitech dongle came with it and is found in the box and not inside the keyboard ~ which has a storage compartment for it next to the batteries.

Ie, you can't get it up much past 50-60 degrees. Without the grip there is much more movement.\nTo get around this I simply collapse one of the legs a bit that is in line with the lens to get nearly 80 degrees of tilt.

I wanted a BlueTooth speaker that was rugged, had replaceable batteries and was LOUD for my workspace.  I work in a noisy, rough and rather small workspace and this speaker is PLENTY loud.  For this I am very pleased.  Replaceable batteries are very important to me.  I just cannot understand spending a lot of money on more expensive bluetooth speakers only to become chagrined when the batteries are no longer useful.  What do you do with an expensive speaker when the batteries cannot any longer hold a charge or recharge ?\n\nYou can purchase replaceable batteries from the manufacturer of this speaker.  In the owner's manual there are ordering instructions.\n\nI would recommend initially buying a pair of backup batteries right away for this product if you will be planning to play it for long periods of time drawing from battery power.  From my experience, the useful playtime I get from this speaker is about 8 hours.  But I like to blast the music so my time is a bit shorter than that.  Whenever possible and practical, I will use this unit under power to save my batteries.\n\nI would not expect this unit to fill up a large room with sound, but it can do a decent job inside a home.\nBut for me, I would want to blow out my windows so  inside my house I will use my amplified speakers hooked to my power receiver.\n\nThis unit can play off a USB stick.  But it is limited.  I tried playing off my  USB stick with over 250 songs.  This unit cannot possibly cache that many music files as the o/s inside is very limited.  But this is not what I bought it for.  I think the unit could only process about 5 songs.\n\nI do use this units Bluetooth feature but also use a speaker cable as well when playing off my MP3 player which does not have Bluetooth.\n\nOverall, I am extremely happy that I now hvae a speaker that performs extremely well.\nAND, I avoided having to spend $300 on a Bluetooth speaker.\nIf those units were more rugged and had REPLACEABLE BATTERIES,  I may have thought and considered a bit longer about spending more.\n\nThis unit does everything I need it for.", "summary": "Everything I want in a Bluetooth speaker without having to spend $300", "unixReviewTime": 1518307200}

It will disappoint as a substitute for really expensive hardware, and won't meet the requirements of most artists.\n\nIt IS an alternative for note taking for me, if imperfect one.  Advantages over pen and paper:\n-  weighs 11 ounces (no more than a 80-sheet pad of paper) but stores about 1000 pages;\n-  makes it easy to manage, share, and file/archive pages (can connect to any Bluetooth or USB device, and integrates with Evernote);\n-  has a smaller carbon footprint than paper (uses almost no power, and sacrifices no trees, and can operate for years);\n\nOn the other hand, downsides compared with pen and paper:\n-  Slipperier to write on (though this device beats a stylus on a tablet or phone);\n-  Black and white only and the display offers limited contrast (though saved images are crisp black and white);\n-  Less ability to vary line thickness than a good pen on paper;\n-  I can write only about half as much per page as I'd put onto a standard size sheet of paper;\n-  Can record only using the stylus, which is pricey to replace if lost (the tablet stores it securely);\n-  Can't recall a saved image to the device display (which would be nice for reference or adding more info).\n\nSo as an atternative to pen and paper there are pros and cons; the pros have it for me but the cons could be the bigger factor for some.  On the other hand, for some the alternative is taking notes with a stylus on a tablet, touchscreen laptop, or phone.  If this is you, consider this product's several advantages:\n-  Instant feedback like pen on paper (no \"lag\" between drawing a line and seeing it)\n-  Feels more like writing on paper;\n-  Easier to read in bright light, even out of doors\n-  Uses much less power (can go a week between charges in regular use);\n-  Thinner and lighter and more durable but less pricey than those other devices.\n\nCompared with a tablet, touchscreen, or phone, the disadvantages of this device:\n-  Can't retrieve a saved note to the screen for reference or amendment;\n-  Adds another device to your bag when you're moving about;\n-  Can't change colors; can't adjust line width much;\n-  Low contrast can be harder to see in low light (like a darkened lecture room).\n\nSo once again, what will win one convert will be unworkable for another, depending on how one sees these trade-offs.", "summary": "On balance I'm impressed; getting a lot of use out of it.", "unixReviewTime": 1522972800}

Nonetheless, straight out of the box this DVD player disappointed me with the first DVD I played in it, and so I've decided to return it for a refund.\n\nI made my decision to purchase this DVD player based on the fact that it was the second best-selling DVD player on Amazon at the time when I decided to purchase it and the positive reviews it had written about it.  I needed a DVD player to replace one that had stopped working, which was being used with an old non-HD TV.  After reviewing what was available on Amazon this one seemed like a smart choice and the price was right, so I decided to purchase it.\n\nThis DVD player was fairly easy to install and use, however what caused me to decide to return it is that I immediately noticed horizontal lines across the screen of the TV whenever people would speak during the movie I was watching.  The lines weren't awful or distracting enough for me to want to stop watching the movie, however I knew that I had not seen them before when the previous DVD player was working, which lead me to believe that it was the new DVD player causing these lines and not something else.\n\nIn addition to noticing the lines, I also noticed that this DVD was loud; I could hear it spinning the DVD inside of it from across the living room.  If this spinning noise was the only problem with the DVD player I would have kept it, however the lines on the TV screen was enough already to cause me to return it.\n\nBased on how popular this DVD player is and all of the positive reviews that it has received, chances are that my experience is just a one-off experience, however it did happen so therefore this DVD player is not receiving a positive review.  Thankfully Amazon has a no hassle return policy, and I am able to return it without paying shipping and get a refund  Hopefully my experience is just a one-off experience, and that everybody else's isn't the same.", "summary": "Defective on arrival", "unixReviewTime": 1530748800}

I struggled to decide whether to give this  2 or 3 stars.  I finally settled on 2.\nOn the plus side, this unit was probably the cheapest one out there.  I have used Rosewill products before so I did not hesitate to purchase this.  This comes with a cute little switch, and at the press of a button you are sent from one PC to the other.\nOn the unit that houses the cables, there are clear markings of PC1 and PC2.  A green LED shows you which computer you are running.\nThis seems to be a well made piece of equipment.\nSo why only 2 stars?  The annoying issue is that every time I switched back and forth between PC's, my screen resolution was set to a lower resolution.  I kept needing to go into the display menu, ask to detect the resolution, and then apply that resolution.  Of course, also, my icons were all moved around after I did that.

Then again I am not a huge gamer, so taking my opinion on gaming is probably a bad move.  Regardless, it is a good brand with a great picture, and for the price I paid I am quite happy.\n\nLike a lot of the other reviews have mentioned it does have a big d pad style button on the back for all the controls.  Would it have been nice to have the buttons in the front or on the bottom, sure, but who really uses the settings on a monitor anyway?  Maybe you use the button a few times to get the settings you need, then you probably never touch the button again.  The computer tuns the monitor on/off for you.  Apparently there is some sort of software you can install to control the settings with the keyboard/mouse, but who needs the extra bloatware for something you will use once or twice.\n\nIf I had any complaints about the monitor at all, it would have been nice to have displayport.

This is helpful so you can plug things in without having to get at the back of your computer. It's great for tower computers.  There is a Blue LED status indicator on each port.  Each of the 3 smart charging ports are 2.4 amps & you can charge multiple smartphones & tablets at the same time. It has a 60 watt power output.  You do not have to install any drivers, so just plug it in & you're ready to use it. It includes a 12 V 5A AC/DC power adapter.\n\nI rated it 4/5 stars. The one problem is that the USB 3.0 cable that comes with it is only 32 inches long. It's not long enough! It would have been better if it came with a 6 ft cable because if you have a computer tower, it is barely enough to reach up to the desk. So that is the reason I deducted 1 star from the rating.

Then it says nothing more except to be sure to set the date and time properly. No explanation is provided how to do this. Because of the clunky interface I could not do it. It is not intuitive at all. Like all gadgets that you need to set the date and time on, they decide to reinvent the wheel.

Apps took a long time to open (30-90 seconds), and at times crashed before they could open.  Tablet had difficulty staying connected to the internet even though I have a stable connection (my other devices  my Roku box, my blu-ray player, my phone and my computer had no such issues).

I then connected the Xbox to one of the two network connections on the back of this.\n\nPowering it up, it took a minute but then all the lights went green.  First. The Xbox. In settings, it now said wired instead of wireless. Haven't downloaded anything yet, but I expect it to be fast.  I went upstairs and did the 'test streaming'.

One had recently started making noise again. Rather than oil it as I have done in the past when this happened I decided to replace it.\n\nI really only needed one fan but, when you add shipping to the lower priced fans that are sold individually the price is a bit too high. And, the average price of budget fans seems to be around 8 dollars for one. That is why this is such a great deal! Five fans at 8 bucks each come to $40 bucks and that is before shipping is added.\n\nI got free shipping on these making the deal even better.\n\nThe lights are far brighter than I expected. I did check out the photos in other reviews but, I must say none of the photos accurately represent just how vivid the color is and how bright the light is.\n\nAfter seeing how the lights looked when I swapped out the noisy fan I decided to swap out the fan in the front of my case even though that one was still working fine. I thought it would look night having more visible light coming through the front of my case (the original fans are the kind with a couple of blue LED's in the center the light pattern is different with these new ones but far more visible through the structure of the case.\n\nI did not replace the 3 case fan as the last one is in the back and I really don't see that under normal circumstances.\n\nSo, I have 3 spare fans in case I need them.\n\nYes, there are better fans on the market but you will pay far more for them.\n\nThese look great and work as expected.\n\nI opted for blue as that is the color of the LED's in my original fans (I had no choice of color when I built my computer, I just bought the least expensive fans they had). Over the years I grew accustomed to that color. However, if the green and red are as vivid in person as these blue ones I think either of those would have been a great color choice too (though that is just an opinion of aesthetics).\n\nThey are quiet but far from silent.\n\nIf I have one criticism of these fans it would be the rubber anti-vibration pads. Given that they are part of the structure it is not as if you can test how well they work by using the fans without them compared to with them. Also, the anti-vibration pads are not especially thick so, once you tighten the screws you will tend to compress them enough where I think it is doubtful they have any actual effect when it comes to canceling vibration. A couple of rubber washers could accomplish the same thing in my opinion. Though it would be harder to get washers in place while installing a fan. So, being an actual part of the fan design is good in that aspect.\n\nTo sum up, if you are in need of some fans these are a very good choice. they are decent fans at an excellent price.", "summary": "decent fans at an excellent price", "unixReviewTime": 1525132800}

Indeed, the MDR7506 is the \"go to\" headphones for industry. Period. They are the original Xerox machines of photocopying, they are the Kleenex of facial tissue paper, they are the Listerine of mouthwashes, the Corn Flakes of breakfast cereal, the KDKA of AM radio stations.  Often copied, rarely duplicated, the MDR7506 stand as testament to the idea that good design trumps all even in this day of breakneck technological innovation.  Released some nearly 3 decades ago, they remain the industry standard.\n\nBefore I continuing, let's get old thing out of the way (if only because it seems to be repeated in so many headphone reviews and provides a point of context for a younger generation or two). Yes, these headphones sound better, are better built, last longer, and will give you a more enjoyable music listening experience than will \"Beats / Monster Beats / Apple Beats / Beats by Dre\"...oh, and they cost much less.\n\nTo my own ears, the 7506 provides that \"motion thump\" that is necessary to bring modern pop, rock, EDM, and other bass-heavy genres come to life.  It's not overly bass-y and certainly not distorting or loose. It's tight, rich without being too brassy, and balances the wide field into the highs naturally and with as flat a response as you're likely to hear without a laboratory.\n\nAs a synthesizer programmer, lifelong player, sound designer, and enthusiast, I always describe the 7506 this way: They are the only cans that can accurately reproduce an open cutoff saw or supersaw. Period.  Everything else is relative to the 7506 cans. For those who aren't synth heads, let me put that in English: \"You hear EVERYTHING\"... and in the proper ratios and levels. Good or bad, there's no kimono to lift with filters with these cans, the sound is naked and true. If you can't mix with these, then give up on mixing even with open air monitors, you'll never hear well enough to get your room acoustics right.\n\nYes.

Fujifilm doesn't make this.\n\nIn a way I'm kind of glad, because this is the exact same thing as the Canon and Nikon counterparts, except this is cheaper than how much I've spent on the Canon one.\n\nThis however, this trigger release uses AAA batteries rather than the button type battery (which annoys the hell out of me, cuz my Canon one doesn't have a OFF switch, so the battery drains really fast).\n\nThis also uses a 2.5mm sub mini port instead of proprietary port like Canon. Also this is just the perfect thing for my Fujifilm GFX 50S since it has a little flap dedicated for 2.5mm sub mini. So when I use this all other ports on the camera is not exposed to the elements.\n\nAfter using this for quite some time, now I've came down with this conclusion: this trigger release cable is also pretty tough!\nI've banned it on floors and my tripod many times, no signs of defect.

Im loving the Bluesound Node.  This is my first experience with Bluesound, and its been nothing but positive.  I used the included RCA cables to connect it to my Yamaha receiver, downloaded the app to both my iPad and my Android phone, and it was good to go.  No problems with anything.  The app makes it very easy to find things to listen to on sources such as iHeartRadio, TuneIn, and Spotify (links to these and more are already installed) as well as to link it to other sources.  So far, Ive used it with music on my iPad, linked it to my Amazon Prime music, and set up Tidal, all very easily.\n\nThe Node would be great if all it did was organize all your listening sources, because it makes everything so convenient.  The sound, though, is so good!  Its amazing what it finds in music, every note and nuance.  I think Im going to be able to justify my monthly Tidal bill with my savings in CD and streaming music purchases.  I always felt I had to have my CDs because the sound just wasn't as good elsewhere, but this setup has completely turned my thinking around.\n\nThe unit comes with cables to connect it a variety of ways:  RCA, 3.5 stereo mini-plug, Toslink adaptor (but no optical cable), and Ethernet cable (it does not require a wired connection; Im using it with wi-fi).  It also has both 120 and 230 AC power cords.  The Quick Start guide proved to be exactly thatno glitches, just a quick start.  The unit is not very big, and its appearance blends in nicely with the rest of my system.\n\nYears ago, when I bought my first record player, I realized that with hi-fi, there is no endpoint.  There is always a little something more you could do to tweak your system if you have a few more dollars to spend.  As with all music playback components, whether an investment in a Node 2 is a good idea for you depends on how you like to listen to music and what you want from the music you listen to.  If you're committed to the high end of hi-fi, I highly recommend this addition to your system.", "summary": "Great addition to my system", "unixReviewTime": 1516838400}
