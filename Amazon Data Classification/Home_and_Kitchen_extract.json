We regarded it highly but are now very skeptical about the ethics of this company.  We have recently received a class action invitation and only then became aware about Vitamix blenders shedding TEFLON each time when you run them.  I was pretty upset because rather than reaching out to former clients IMMEDIATELY upon knowing the issue - Vitamix just hoped it would disappear until they got sued.  I would never, never again buy a product from Vitamix.  We avoid in our household all kinds of Teflon material and learning that the very piece of equipment that we bought for health was actually adding Teflon in diet for years - was a very nasty surprise.  Apparently they fixed the issue in 2015 and they did not bother to contact all their customers to offer free replacement.  While currently Teflon seems to be OK we don't know what new discoveries will be made.  For now, we are sending (we contacted recently and they offered to replace the seals in our containers) what we have back and unwillingly probably will use it occasionally.  This whole issue (in my view) was a profits over health or at least customer satisfaction issue.  On more uses I can also say that cleaning this item is a hassle.  The 48 oz container is hard to reach and fit in most sinks.  We got recently a german brand - that is glass, has no teflon and while less powerful it seems to be OK for ordinary use.  If you need to make blended food for medical reasons make especially sure that you have a new container from Vitamix that does not infuse Teflon to your diet.", "summary": "Years of Teflon exposure - thanks to Vitamix.", "unixReviewTime": 1524873600}

It was a very good purchase, and I'm really excited I found it.\n\nI would warn, however, that after a single washing the towel looks a little bit dull and ragged, with a few dangling threads, and overall looking not quite as grand as it initially did. In the future, I will probably throw this hand towel, or one like it, into a mesh bra bag before washing, in order to preserve its too-fleeting elegance.

It started whistling loudly, with a two-tone, loud, but not unpleasant sound.\n\nIt had been heating up long enough to make the handle too hot to pick it up with.  I'd had the gas burner on full-blast, so this didn't surprise me.  I poured out the water into my coffee container to let it steep.  There was still a fair amount of water in it, so I decided to put it back on the flame and see if it whistled with a smaller amount of water.  The cover on the spout is a small, hinged cover that's held in place by gravity.  I figured that the steam pressure would vent up the spout, and stop the whistle from happening.  As it started boiling, I noticed steam coming out the spout, but then after a few seconds, the whistle went off, quieter, and without the distinctive notes I'd heard before, but it was there.\n\nSo, I think the two things needed for a loud and distinctive whistle are:  Fill it up past the spout-holes, and push the lid on tightly.  And use a hot pad to pick it up.\n\nI make a large, 20 ounce glass of coffee in the morning, and make it last through the day.  This pot is just the right size for my needs. It looks good, seems to be very sturdy, and it works well, from my first use of it.  If anything needs reporting in the future, I'll come back and let you know.", "summary": "Here's whistling at you, kid - but use a hot pad.", "unixReviewTime": 1527724800}

This will give you a minimal 1/64\" margin all the way around and allow room for the wetting solution to escape while pressing the film in place with the squeegee.\n4. If you're getting frustrated, remove the film, re-wet, and start again (making sure you don't get any dirt on the window side of the film.\n\nAfter a few months, the product has performed as expected with no bubbling or blisters.

All the pieces were there and all the holes were drilled correctly.\nSome pointers if you buy this. 1) You can tell the direction of all 4 drawer sides by looking at the 'rounded edge' of each piece. Also on the drawers, keep the wheel in the track to the outside and to the rear of the drawer. 2) Part \"(v)\" is hidden in the packing of the top, its wrapped in foam and looks like scrap if you don't look closely. 3) The center \"walls\" with the drawer slides attached have pegs on the bottom, not the top. and the slides face inward, this should tell you direction for those. Everything else has a different letter designation on it to tell you its position.  I opted not to use the casters on mine after reading several reviews, if you do use them, do yourself a favor and use carriage bolts and washers from the inside through a drilled hole to lock nuts on the caster side. the tiny wood screws they provide for these are what causes the issue with them tearing out. I bought 4\" solid wood feet to put on mine  *the casters measure 3 and 3/4 inches from floor to plate. The cart measures 32\" with no casters installed.

Solidly build, but light enough to carry when full (I would expect a med-small framed woman to NOT be able to carry it full, and perhaps a medium sized guy might struggle). I really like it. Its walls are thick enough to make it solid, but not too thick to add excess weight (nor act as an unnecessary heat sink when heating its contents). The lid is flat and indented, fitting in, not over the pot (just slightly). This means condensation won't leak out readily. Handles are bolted on, but show no signs of loosening in the several months I've had it. The one thing I wasn't thinking about when I bought it, was how it fit on my gas stove top. It doesn't quite center on the back burners (which I much prefer to use), the distance between the back controls of the over/stove and the burner isn't quite large enough, so it is just slightly off center. Still, that isn't a problem for me (ymmv), and heats evenly and quickly (for a pot of that size). I only give 5 star ratings to things which I view not just as excellent but excellent values.

I just premeasure the water before boiling so I can just pour the whole kettle over it (takes a couple pours since the filter doesnt hold 16oz. I like big coffees.  I have an espresso maker but have wanted to cut back on the mochas and don't have room for a full coffee pot so this is perfectly tiny.

All I need to do is boil water ovee the fire and I have an instant pot of fresh coffee.

The seal between cover and cup depends on a soft gasket material that is prone to leaks. The cover itself holds another elastic material that is supposed to plug both the drink flow opening and the vent hold, but that seal is also prone to leaks as it ages. Most problematic is that the flip mechanism is actuated by an elastic that is doomed to fail sooner or later. Mine failed in less than a year. When I contacted Thermos, I was \"handled\" by a surly customer service rep who said she'd arrange for a replacement cover to be sent to me, but that failure mode was due to fair wear and tear, and I'd have to purchase new caps when (not if) they failed again.

This item is also easily clean. Nothing has burnt to the machine. It's stores nicely. It's not a bulky item. It's attractive and the packaging is easily manageable. You can unpack it and the instructions are a little hilarious to read, but you'll figure it out. Anyway it's a nice cute unit to have.

I am not sure what other reviewers that complain of wobbling legs did wrong, but this is table very sturdy. Perhaps they didn't tighten the leg bolts enough. It is a bit finicky tightening the bolts for the legs but if you angle the wrench just right you can get them very secure.\nIt is a very nice size, small but still comfortable.\nThe packaging was decent. It came in two boxes, one for the table top and one for the pedestal and legs, and was well padded. Mine came with a couple very small scratches on the inside edge of one of the drop leaves, but honestly  at the price of $125, a couple of very tiny scuff marks are hardly something for me to worry about.\n I purchased the oak color and it is a bit paler than I expected. I am used to oak being a bit more golden, but I am actually really please with the lighter color. The wood is solid and appears to be durable (though I just put it together so only time will tell if my observations are correct)\nThe directions are very easy to follow and written in clear English. The hardware came in two bags so you do have to separate them yourself but again, for $125 I am ok with having to sort a few nuts and bolts. This took me about 30 minutes to put together by myself, and the only additional tool I needed was a screw driver.\nOver all this is an excellent little table and I would encourage anyone who is looking for a space saving table to buy one.", "summary": "Very sturdy and easy to assemble", "unixReviewTime": 1519084800}

I tested this one for less than 10 minutes and noticed immediately that the sliding temperature selector does not go high enough to select linen without using both thumbs and more pressure than the other settings need.  It did get hot enough for ironing the cotton fabric.\n\nHowever, there is still the problem of the auto shut off feature.  It is very inadequately described on the Amazon web page.  I did not want one that shut off after a few seconds when the iron is in the ironing (flat) position.  I used to iron to make a little extra money.  When I had family at home, sometimes ironing would take a few hours.  (Admittedly, that was 'back in the day' when ironing was customary.)  Those activities can't be efficiently and calmly done when you have to restart the iron frequently.  What if you are ironing long or wide items and need more than a few seconds?  What if an embroidery transfer needs more time?  What if you make quilts and need to go back and forth from sewing to ironing?  My last iron shut off after a few seconds and made ironing a misery, so I threw it away.\n\nThe instructions for this iron do not fully describe the auto-off function so I am not sure if it turns off after 10 seconds, 30 seconds, or some other length of time when it is in the flat position; however, the included instructions say \"Timed auto-off will automatically turn unit off after 30 minutes.\"  That takes care of the questions I just asked:  It doesn't matter how long you *need* to iron or whether you move the iron from flat to upright.  You are only allowed 30 minutes.  The Sunbeam webpage description and a chat with a nice woman at Sunbeam confirm that.  Having to regularly turn the iron back on is not acceptable.\n\nThe instructions go on to say \"3-way auto-off (15 min in heeled position).\"  And that is all.\n\nBasically, the instructions say that 1) the iron will shut off regardless of activity in 30 minutes, 2) it will shut off in 15 minutes when left in the upright position, and 3) will shut off at some point for some undefined reason.\n\nI will continue to research irons and will find one without the auto-off feature.", "summary": "Inadequate and limiting", "unixReviewTime": 1521763200}
