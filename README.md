### Project 1: Cigarette Smoking in Adolescents

  - Extension of final course project (Applied Quantitative Analysis) that investigates the correlation between the smoking habits of American adolescents and the strength of their religious beliefs.
  - The study involves running several multinomial logistic regression models in R on propensity-score-matched data, controlling for factors like gender, cigarette access at home and parent’s smoking history.
  - The study finds a strong negative correlation between the two variables, with stress (denoted by sleep problems) and cigarette access at home being the other statistically and practically significant factors.
